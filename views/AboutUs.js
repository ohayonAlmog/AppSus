          <h2>Rania Elizabeth Kittan</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Rania! A lover of all things creative - from drawing and art to literature and code. As a former English teacher, I've always had a passion for language and expression, and my journey has led me to explore different mediums of self-expression. You can usually find me listening to Pink Floyd, spending time with my two cats, or just being my slightly weird but always genuine self.</p>
